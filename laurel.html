            <p>Laurel Hell is Mitski's sixth album, and has a similar style to Be the Cowboy, musically speaking. She wrote most of the album's songs during 2018 and the lockdowns, during her break. The album features eleven tracks and was released in 2022.</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> This album is the first album after Mitski's four-year break. She named this album Laurel Hell because there's a plant called laurel bushes and when you get stuck in these thickets, you can't get out. Mitski believes that laurel flowers are beautiful, and she likes the notion of dying within the explosion of flowers.
                <li> Laurel Hell wasn't popular among listeners, but I like it because it's so beautiful. It also gives me the feeling that if nobody understands how you feel, Mitski does. My favorite songs on this album are "Should've Been Me" and "Everyone."
