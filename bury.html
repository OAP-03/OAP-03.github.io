            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This is Mitski's third album, which she wrote when she was exhausted from having to make money after college. She learned guitar for it, and wrote the whole album by herself. The album features ten tracks, and was released in 2014.</p>

            <h4>The Tracks:</h4>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Bury Me At Makeout Creek pushed Mitski into having more fans because the album is such a banger! It has the same emotion as her past two albums but is more "digestible" to a larger audience.
                <li> This album was one of my favorites when I first started listening to Mitski. Each song can convey a different feeling at a different moment, and I love it. It's hard to pick a favorite song because they are all so good, but I would most likely choose "Drunk Walk Home" or "I Donâ€™t Smoke."
