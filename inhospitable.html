            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This album is Mitski's seventh and most current album. It has eleven tracks and was released in 2023. The font, "Ready" was possibly used to convey that the land is so inhospitable because the font is so unreadable.</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We is Mitski's most American album. It exploded into popularity, due to the song "My Love, Mine All Mine" which is NOT about proclaiming love (which many TikTok users think it is about). It is about how nothing is permanent, and nobody owns anything, except love. The main theme of this album is love.
                <li> This is the first album where I was closely following each release. I remember that I was on vacation when the music videos dropped, and I was in the car, watching them as we drove. There are so many amazing songs on this album, but my favorites are "I Don't Like My Mind" and "The Deal."
