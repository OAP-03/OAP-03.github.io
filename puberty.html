            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Puberty 2 is one of Mitskiâ€™s best albums. It's an indie-rock album dedicated to all emotions. The album name is a testament to the fact all the confusion and anxiety that happens during puberty never ends, and she's fine with that.
                <li> I used to love this album when I was younger, about twelve or thirteen years old. This album made me believe that at least one person (Mitski) understood my problems. My favorite songs on this album are "My Body's Made of Crushed Little Stars" and "Fireworks."
