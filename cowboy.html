            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> This album's title was inspired by a peer from college who performed with "cowboy swagger." After she graduated, she missed seeing him perform and became the cowboy. This album is about changing identity, by using accommodation, self-advancement, and self-actualization.
                <li> Be the Cowboy is one of her best albums! It was released before her four-year break. I love this album because its music is amazing. The tracks have a wide range of instruments and emotions behind them. My favorite songs on this album are "A Pearl" and "Washing Machine Heart."
