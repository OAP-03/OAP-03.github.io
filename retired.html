            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Retired from Sad, New Career in Business also has that emotional rawness that Lush has. The album mainly features orchestral music, as Mitski used the student orchestra at her college.
                <li> This album was one of my favorites when I first started listening to Mitski. Each song can convey a different feeling at a different moment, and I love it. It's hard to pick a favorite song because they are all so good, but I would most likely choose "Drunk Walk Home" or "I Donâ€™t Smoke."
